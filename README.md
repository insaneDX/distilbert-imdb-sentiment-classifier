# DistilBERT IMDB Sentiment Classifier

Fine-tuning DistilBERT for binary sentiment classification on the IMDB movie reviews dataset using Hugging Face Transformers.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a pre-trained DistilBERT model for sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset. The model classifies movie reviews as either **Positive** or **Negative** with high accuracy.

### Key Features

- Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Efficient fine-tuning with Hugging Face Trainer API
- Detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations
- Mixed precision training (FP16) for faster training
- Comparison between base and fine-tuned model performance

## Results
